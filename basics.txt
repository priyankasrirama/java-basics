git:
	technology/language for source code management
	java/dot net code or any code
	we need to save in some location
	code pull/push/clone
	git is language to provide these commands to save our source code

github/bitbucket/gitlab:
	cloud providers/applications using git language

notepad++, visual code, sublime - editors like notepad

difference between source file and binary file
	source file: .java, .py, .scala
	binary files: 
		java -> class files - this is called binary
		installable files binary files

tortoise git, git gui, source tree:
	to execute git commands tortoise git is GUI(Graphical User Interface) client
	github/bitbucket/gitlab - connect - git commands execute

java code terminology:
ABC.java file - source code, code we write
ABC.class file - byte code. process of converting .java file to .class is called compilation
jdk - java development kit - JRE + Tools
	jdk-8 installation softwares
		tools to compile java file
		tools to execute byte(.class) code
		tools to monitor applications developed in java
		javac - java compiler
		JRE - Java Runtime Environment
			jvm - java virtual machine
			library classes
		Is common for all OSs

Javac - java compiler
	tool to compile .java file to .class file

JVM:
	tool which convert byte code to machine level language and execute our byte code

library classes:
	classes that support execution of byte code
	these comes as jar files while installation of jdk/jre

JRE - JVM + library classes
	we can decide whether to install only jdk or jre
	jre is specific to OS

where we write java code:
	.java files
	javac - .class files
	we can write in notepad .java file and compile it
	IDE - Integrated development Environment
		Eclipse
		STS
		IntelliJ
		we configure JDK in IDE so that when we make any changes to java file automatically class file will be generated
		since we are configuring JDK in IDE, it will have path to JRE also
		since it has access to JRE path, we can directly execute java code from IDE

.java file, jar file, war, ear:
	java file - 1 java file we write
	jar file - zip of multiple java files - java archive file
	war file - group of multiple jar files - web archive file
	ear - group of multiple war and jar files - enterprise archive file
	we need application/web servers to run war files
	we need application servers to run ear files

application server: more features, takes more time to start. mostly licensed
	weblogic
	websphere
	jboss
	wildfly

web servers: light weigh. starts fast, mostly open source
	tomcat
	jetty
	undertow

STS - codebase vs workspace
	every STS we run we need to assocaite with workspace(one folder with that instance of STS configuration)
	codebase - out java application code that we import

SQL - language specification to query data
	data saved in rows and columns in tables

SQL providers:
	Oracle
		SQL Developer tool is client to connect oracle database
		TOAD
	MySQL
		client: mysql workbench 
	SQL server
		client: sql server management studio
	H2
		client: h2

NoSQL - 
	no structure to data
	saved in json format

java:
	core java
	advanced java - mainly used for web applications
	javaee - mainly used for complex web applications
	frameworks - libraries to support application development
		spring
		spring boot

UI:
	javascript
	angular js
	angular
	react
	node
	npm
	etc
	typescript
	coffescript
